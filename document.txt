Hello! 
I am Mir Mohaiminul Islam. I am 25 years old. I am a Trainee SQA Engineer at BJIT. Everyday I have tolarate boring lecture of the mentor. Only common training session is good I think. I want to do technical work rather than faul theory class. 

In my past I first try to learn Laravel but I can't get success. Now I moved to SQA .Lets see what happen.

I am waiting for mentor change I hope mentor will changed very soon. Current mentor's english spoken is very bad. I also don't like my friend muftahin joy. He is an asshole. He create a group but didn't call me. I call him to make a group first. If he is not interested he can mention me earlier. I will not trust his again.
