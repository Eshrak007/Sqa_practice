Hello! 
I am Mir Mohaiminul Islam. I am 25 years old. I am a Trainee SQA Engineer at BJIT. Everyday I have tolarate boring lecture of the mentor. Only common training session is good I think. I want to do technical work rather than faul theory class. 

In my past I first try to learn Laravel but I can't get success. Now I moved to SQA .Lets see what happen.

I hope one day I will see success . I hope the darkness will eradicated one day
